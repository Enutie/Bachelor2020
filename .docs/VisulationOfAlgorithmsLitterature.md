# Algorithm Animations for Teaching and Learning the Main Ideas of Basic Sortings

*Ladislav Végh*

**Abstract**:

Algorithms are hard to understand for novice computer science students because they dynamically modify values of elements of abstract data structures. Animations can help to understand algorithms, since they connect abstract concepts to real life objects and situations. In the past 30–35 years, there have been conducted many experiments in the field of usage of animations and visualizations in education, but they showed mixed results. In this paper, we review past research within the field and summarize recommendations regarding the graphic design and interactivity of the animations. In the second part of the paper, we present our interactive card sorting animations with conceptual views. The goal of these animations is to help students understand the main ideas and differences between basic sorting algorithms. In a pedagogical experiment related to these animations, 92 first-year computer science students of J. Selye University in Komarno (Slovakia) were asked to fill in a pre-test, experiment with the interactive animations, and fill in a post-test. The results showed that animations helped students to understand essential aspects of sorting algorithms. However, the participants were not able to understand the sorting algorithms in detail, so other types of animations are needed to teach algorithms in-depth.

# Learning how to program through visualization: A pilot study on the Bubble Sort algorithm

*Peter Bellstrom, Claes Thoren*

**Abstract**: A well-known difficulty when teaching and learning programming is the diverse educational background of IT students. In this paper we argue that a central factor agitating this problem is the tradition of teaching programming using a syntax perspective: Between the initial step of learning syntax, and the end step of achieving practical application, logic exists as a midpoint, representing the students' understanding. In this paper we propose the opposite strategy: We present a qualitative pilot study that within its initial findings indicate that through visualization, the logic component in the learning process can be empowered to facilitate an application perspective to achieve syntax. Previous research in the field shows that there is potential for using visualization to eliminate the obstacle of abstract problem-solving for students of programming. Our study uses the simple but multilayered bubble sort algorithm to examine how visualization can promote a theory of understanding that facilitates learning and comprehension through application rather than through syntax. The initial results of the pilot study indicate that there is definite potential for visualization to assist students of varying backgrounds when learning programming.

# THE METHODS AND GOALS OF TEACHING SORTING ALGORITHMS IN PUBLIC EDUCATION

*Péter Bernát*

**Abstract**:  The topic of sorting algorithms is a pleasant subject of informatics education. Not only is it so because the notion of sorting is well known from our everyday life, but also because as an algorithm task, whether we expect naive or practical solutions, it is easy to define and demonstrate. In my paper I will present some of the possible methods and goals of teaching sorting algorithms in the primary and the secondary school context. Some of the applicable demonstration and collaborative methods will be listed and illustrated with examples available on the internet. Next to defining the teaching goals offered by the specific methods, I will also make suggestions which methods are optimal for a given teaching phase.

# Evaluating animations as student aids in learning computer algorithms

*Michael D. Byrnea, RichardCatramboneb, John T. Staskoc*

**Abstract**: We conducted two experiments designed to examine whether animations of algorithms would help students learn the algorithms more effectively. Across the two studies we used two different algorithms — depth-first search and binomial heaps — and used two different subject populations — students with little or no computer science background and students who were computer science majors — and examined whether animations helped students acquire procedural and conceptual knowledge about the algorithms. The results suggest that one way animations may aid learning of procedural knowledge is by encouraging learners to predict the algorithm's behavior. However, such a learning improvement was also found when learners made predictions of an algorithm's behavior from static diagrams. This suggests that prediction, rather than animation per se, may have been the key factor in aiding learning in the present studies. These initial experiments served to highlight a number of methodological issues that need to be systematically addressed in future experiments in order to fully test the relationship between animation and prediction as well as to examine other possible benefits of animations on learning.

# Techniques for Visualizing Data Structures in Algorithmic Animations

*Margarita. Esponda Argüero*

**Abstract**: This paper deals with techniques for the design and production of appealing algorithmic animations and their use in computer science education. A good visual animation is both a technical artifact and a work of art that can greatly enhance the understanding of an algorithm's workings. In the first part of the paper, I show that awareness of the composition principles used by other animators and visual artists can help programmers to create better algorithmic animations. The second part shows how to incorporate those ideas in novel animation systems, which represent data structures in a visually intuitive manner. The animations described in this paper have been implemented and used in the classroom for courses at university level.

# Algorithm Animation for Teaching

*Rudolf Fleischer,  Luděk Kučera*

**Abstract**: We give an overview of rules and techniques to create a good algorithm animation, with emphasis on animations that would be used when teaching algorithms. In this context, we propose that animations should in particular emphasize the visualization of correctness invariants and the complexity of the algorithms. This implies that writing a good animation must be more than just showing the graphically enhanced runtime debugging provided by most common animation systems; instead, each animation must be individually designed and programmed.

# Sorting out sorting - The sequel

*David Furcy, Thomas L. Naps, Jason Wentworth*

**Abstract**: Ronald Baecker's Sorting Out Sorting (SOS) set the stage for much of what has followed in the evolution of algorithm visualization (AV). That period of evolution has now spanned over a quarter century, and we have learned much about how to effectively use AV. This paper addresses how we can incorporate that knowledge into a new rendition of SOS, which we call SOS - The Sequel. In this sequel we attempt to transform Baecker's original video into a highly interactive multimedia learning resource delivered over the Web using Macromedia Flash. The paper describes the design and use of this new resource and reports on a small empirical study designed to measure its effectiveness.

# Algorithm Visualization in CS Education: Comparing Levels of Student Engagement

*Scott Grissom, Myles F. Mcnally, Thomas L. Naps*

**Abstract**: Software technology for algorithm visualization (AV) has advanced faster than our understanding of how such technology impacts student learning. In this paper we present results of a multi-university study. We measured the effect of varying levels of student engagement with AV to learn simple sorting algorithms. These levels included: 1) not seeing any visualization, 2) simply viewing visualizations for a short period in the classroom, and 3) interacting directly with the visualizations for an extended period outside of the classroom. Our results show that learning increases as the level of student engagement increases. AV has a bigger impact on learning when students go beyond merely viewing a visualization and are required to engage in additional activities structured around the visualization. In particular, students who responded to questions integrated into the AV tool during their exploration of an algorithm showed the most improvement between a pretest and posttest.

# Designing Educationally Effective Algorithm Visualizations

*Steven Hansen, N. Hari Narayanan, Mary Hegarty*

**Abstract**: Despite the intuitively compelling adage ‘a picture is worth a thousand words’, a attempts over the past decade to use animations to explain algorithms to students have produced disappointing results. In most cases, interesting algorithm animations were designed, but no formal, systematic evaluations were conducted. When such evaluations were performed the results were mixed, with compelling evidence for the instructional superiority of algorithm animations failing to emerge. It is in this context that we embarked on a research program to develop educationally effective algorithm visualizations. This program was based on the premise that animations needed to be embedded in a knowledge and context providing hypermedia environment in order to effectively harness their power to enhance learning. This paper describes the architecture of the resulting Hypermedia Algorithm Visualization system (HalVis). Four empirical studies with HalVis are described, which demonstrated that the extent of learning exhibited by students who used HalVis was significantly greater than that of students who used means of traditional instruction or a typical algorithm animation.

# Using Visualizations to Learn Algorithms: Should Students Construct Their Own, or View an Expert’s?

*Christopher Hundhausen, Sarah Douglas*

**Abstract**:  Algorithm visualization software graphically illustrates how computer algorithms work. Past experiments designed to substantiate the software’s pedagogical value have yielded mixed results. A review of these studies suggests that the more actively involved learners are in the visualization process, the better they perform. Given this trend, and inspired by ethnographic fieldwork we conducted in an undergraduate algorithms course, we hypothesize that students who use simple art supplies to construct their own visualizations will learn an algorithm better than students who interact with computer-based visualizations constructed by an expert. We conducted an experiment to test this hypothesis, and found no significant differences between the two pedagogical approaches. Thus, students who use “low tech” materials to construct their own visualizations may learn algorithms just as well as students who study conventional “high tech” visualizations constructed by an expert. This result motivates a markedly different kind of algorithm visualization software: one that enables learners to construct their own “low tech” visualizations.

# A Meta-Study of AlgorithmVisualization Effectiveness

*Christopher D. Hundhausen, Sarah A. Douglas, John T. Stasko*

**Abstract**: Algorithm visualization (AV) technology graphically illustrates how algorithms work. Despite the intuitive appeal of the technology, it has failed to catch on in mainstream computer science education. Some have attributed this failure to the mixed results of experimental studies designed to substantiate AV technology’s educational effectiveness. However, while several integrative reviews of AV technologyhave appeared, none has focused speci¢callyon the software’s e¡ectiveness byanalyzing this bodyof experimental studies as a whole. In order to better understand the effectiveness of AV technology, we present a sy stematic meta-study of 24 experimental studies.We pursue two separate analyses: an analysis of independent variables, in which we tie each studyto a particular guiding learning theoryin an attempt to determine which guiding theory has had the most predictive success; and an analysis of dependent variables, which enables us to determine which measurement techniques have been most sensitive to the learning bene¢ts of AV technology. Our most signi¢cant ¢nding is that how students use AV technologyhas a greater impact on e¡ectiveness than what AV technologyshows them. Based on our ¢ndings, we formulate an agenda for future research into AV e¡ectiveness. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

# Integrating algorithm animation into a learning environment

*Charles Kann, Robert W. Lindeman, Rachelle Heller*

**Abstract**: Algorithm animation would seem to be a useful tool for teaching algorithms. However, previous empirical studies of using algorithm animation have produced mixed results. This paper presents an empirical study in which the subjects programmed the algorithm which they had seen animated. The results of the experiment indicate that combining the animation with the implementation of the algorithm was an effective way to teach the animation, and also produced transfer effects for general recursion problems.

# Technologically and artistically enhanced multi-sensory computer-programming education

*Zoltan Katai, Laszlo Toth*

**Abstract**: Over the last decades more and more research has analysed relatively new or rediscovered teaching–learning concepts like blended, hybrid, multi-sensory or technologically enhanced learning. This increased interest in these educational forms can be explained by new exciting discoveries in brain research and cognitive psychology, as well as by the accelerated integration of technology (computers, intranets, internet, etc.) in education. We have investigated how the educationally valuable outcomes of these trends could be implemented in computer-programming education and in what ways this process could be catalysed by arts (dance, music, rhythm, theatrical role-playing). We present a theoretical basis for technologically and artistically enhanced multi-sensory teaching–learning strategies. This work focuses particularly on how dance can be involved in computer science classes.

# Rethinking the evaluation of algorithm animations as learning aids: an observational study

*Colleen Kehoe, John Stasko, Ashley Taylor*

**Abstract**: One important aspect of creating computer programs is having a sound understanding of the underlying algorithms used by programs. Learning about algorithms, just like learning to program, is difficult, however. A number of prior studies have found that using animation to help teach algorithms had less beneficial effects on learning than hoped. Those results surprise many computer science instructors whose intuition leads them to believe that algorithm animations should assist instruction. This article reports on a study in which animation is utilized in more of a “homework” learning scenario rather than a “final exam” scenario. Our focus is on understanding *how* learners will utilize animation and other instructional materials in trying to understand a new algorithm, and on gaining insight into how animations can fit into successful learning strategies. The study indicates that students use sophisticated combinations of instructional materials in learning scenarios. In particular, the presence of algorithm animations seems to make a complicated algorithm more accessible and less intimidating, thus leading to enhanced student interaction with the materials and facilitating learning.

# Using a game-based learning model as a new teaching strategy for computer engineering

*Kristijan Kuk, Dragica Jovanovic, Dusan Jokanovic, Petar Spalevic, Marko Caric, Stefan Panic*

**Abstract**:Interactive multimedia simulations and computer game elements can be successfully combined in order to create new advanced educational resources for teaching today's generation of students. Such a learning environment, a game-based learning model (GBLm), has been designed as a research prototype. This paper describes one type of GBLm for computer engineering, which we have used in the subject of computer graphics for the teaching unit Z-buffer algorithm, in order to facilitate the learning process. The implementation of a GBLm for graphical algorithms (GBL4CAl) is presented in detail as a multimedia interactive learning module designed to motivate students by making learning a more enjoyable process. During the design of the GBL4CAl module, special attention was paid to the integration of pedagogical and game-play aspects.

# A visualisation tool as a demonstration aid

*Matti Lattu, Veijo Meisalo, Jorma Tarhio*

**Abstract**: As algorithms have been seen to be hard to teach and learn, teachers have tried to look for help in algorithm animation. While the effect of algorithm animation on learning has been studied, but not reliably evidenced, this study tries to approach the problem from a different perspective. Sixty hours of assignment sessions in an introductory programming course were observed to determine the kind of demonstration and explaining strategies teachers and students tend to use. The results show that although the variation of different visualisation types is large, there are certain common properties describing the explanation of the programs. Guidelines for demonstration tools are presented based on the results.

# Integrating categories of algorithm learning objective into algorithm visualization design: a proposal

*Ming-Han Lee, Guido Rößling*

**Abstract**: Algorithm Visualization (AV) can be analyzed and evaluated through three properties: the symbol system, the interactivity, and the didactic structure. While the relationship between various symbol systems have been researched and efforts to increase learner and AV interaction are being made, the importance and potential of the didactic structure of AV is yet to be explored. In view of this deficiency, this paper proposes Categories of Algorithm Learning Objective (CALO) as a pedagogical framework for designing and structuring AV. Based on seven non-hierarchical learning objectives commonly found in CS education, CALO provides a conceptual framework for a more learner-centered design, as well as a shared language for educators, learners and designers for communication and evaluation.

# Exploring the role of visualization and engagement in computer science education

*Thomas L Naps, Guido Rößling, Vicki L. Almstrum, Wanda Dann, Rudolf Fleischer, Christopher Hundhausen, Ari Korhonen, Lauri Maimi, Myles F. Mcnaily, Susan H. Rodger, J. Ángel Velázquez-iturbids*

**Abstract**: Visualization technology can be used to graphically illustrate various concepts in computer science. We argue that such technology, no matter how well it is designed, is of little educational value unless it engages learners in an active learning activity. Drawing on a review of experimental studies of visualization effectiveness, we motivate this position against the backdrop of current attitudes and best practices with respect to visualization use. We suggest a new taxonomy of learner engagement with visualization technology. Grounded in Bloom's well-recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest metrics for assessing the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead. Based on these taxonomies of engagement and effectiveness metrics, we present a framework for experimental studies of visualization effectiveness. Interested computer science educators are invited to collaborate with us by carrying out studies within this framework.

# When does higher degree of interaction lead to higher learning in visualizations? Exploring the role of ’Interactivity Enriching Features’.

*Mrinal Patwardhan, Sahana Murthy*

**Abstract**: Interactive visualizations are being used extensively for effective teaching and learning. Higher degree of interaction in visualizations improves comprehension and leads to deeper learning. However, some research studies have reported ambiguous, inconclusive results in terms of learning benefits of interactive visualizations. The conditional results in such studies suggest some additional features to be instrumental in assisting learners in deriving benefits of interactivity in visualizations. We refer to these features as ‘*Interactivity Enriching Features*’. This study examines how degree of interaction of the user with the visualization affects learning outcome. The study proposes how interactivity in visualizations can be enriched by offering apt affordances and evaluates what additional features could make learning from interactive visualizations more effective at the same degree of interaction. The study has been carried out in the context of a course on Signals and Systems in Electrical Engineering on second year engineering students (*N* = 134). The subjects were assigned to one of the four conditions: a Non-Interactive Visualization, an Animation, a Simulation, and an Interactivity Enriched Visualization. The dependent variable was test-score for ‘Understand conceptual knowledge’, ‘Understand procedural knowledge’ and ‘Apply procedural knowledge’ categories. The research findings indicate that, i) different degrees of interaction are required for learning different types of knowledge and ii) interactive visualization could not deliver its learning benefits unless it was augmented by ‘*Interactivity Enriching Features*’ in the form of appropriate affordance for variable manipulation, especially for higher learning outcomes. This research study contributes towards the design of educationally effective interactive visualizations.

# Teaching programming using visualization. 

*Andrew Rudder, Margaret Benard, Shareeda Mohammed*

**Abstract**: Teaching computer programming to young students is a major challenge. This paper describes a web-based course for teaching programming using visualization and a gaming theme. Concepts are taught using real world examples that the target students can identify with; in this way some of the problems related to understanding abstract concepts are alleviated and learning occurs in context. The full range of multimedia technology including animation, sound and video are used to immerse the student in an environment where learning is fun and visual display of the concepts reinforce learning. A gaming theme is used for formative assessment. Students are provided with 'game' activities such as "spot the error", "predict the output" and "put in order". These enhance critical thinking. They test comprehension and knowledge as well as higher order thinking skills.

#  Modelling and simulation as a recognising method in the education.

*Veronika Stoffa*

**Abstract**: Computer animation‐simulation models of complex processes and events, which are the method of instruction, can be an effective didactic device. Gaining deeper knowledge about objects modelled helps to plan simulation experiments oriented on processes and events researched. Animation experiments realized on multimedia computers can aid easier understanding of complex processes and so uncover their essential properties. This article deals with a common theory of modelling and simulation and the usage of methods of modelling and simulation for reinforcement of the education process. Applications of animation‐simulation models described in this article are mathematically based models. These examples are oriented towards selected problems of probability.

# Toward the effective use of educational program animations: The roles of student’s engagement and topic complexity.

*Jaime Urquiza-Fuentes, J. Ángel Velázquez-Iturbide*

**Abstract**: Programming is one of the most complex subjects in computer science degrees. Program visualization is one of the approaches adopted to make programming concepts more accessible to students. In this work we study the educational impact of an active and highly engaging approach, namely the construction of program animations by students. We systematically compared this approach with two instructional scenarios, based on viewing animations and on the traditional instruction without systematic use of animations. A general conclusion of this work is that animations actually improve learning in terms of some educational aspects: short-term and long-term knowledge acquisition, and drop-out rates. Short-term improvements depend on the complexity level of the topic: while there is no impact for simple topics, there is a learning improvement in complex topics using the viewing and constructing approaches, and there is a learning improvement for highly complex topics using the viewing approach. In the long-term, drop-out rates were significantly decreased for students involved in the two most engaging approaches. In addition, both animation viewing and animation construction improved students' passing-rate in the term exam. Nevertheless, we were unable to prove in the long term that students involved in construction tasks yielded higher grades than those involved in viewing tasks.

# Javascript library for developing interactive micro-level animations for teaching and learning algorithms on one-dimensional arrays

*Ladislav Végh*

**Abstract**: The first data structure that first-year undergraduate students learn during the programming and algorithms courses is the one-dimensional array. For novice programmers, it might be hard to understand different algorithms on arrays (e.g. searching, mirroring, sorting algorithms), because the algorithms dynamically change the values of elements. In these situations, visualizations and animations might be helpful didactic tools. In this paper, we briefly overview animations with different views and introduce our Javascript library for developing interactive micro-level animations. Using this library, different sorting algorithm animations were created, which were used in a pedagogical experiment. The results showed that our interactive animations helped students to understand the visualized sorting algorithms.
