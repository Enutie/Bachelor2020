### Are badges useful in education?: it depends upon the type of badge and expertise of learner

*Samuel Abramovich, Christian Schunn , Ross Mitsuo Higashi*

**Abstract:**

Educational Badges are touted as an alternative assessment that can increase
learner motivation. We considered two distinct models for educational badges; merit badges
and videogame achievements. To begin unpacking the relationship between badges and
motivation, we conducted a study using badges within an intelligent-tutor system for teaching
applied mathematics to middle-school students. Our findings indicate that badge earning
could be driven by learner motivations and that systems with badges could have a positive
effect on critical learner motivations. However, badge acquisition patterns were different
across learners with different levels of prior knowledge. Different badge types also affected
different learners motivation. Additionally, we believe that our findings are compatible with
the research finding that extrinsic motivators have a negative influence on learning. The
implication for educational badge designers is that they must consider the ability and motivations of learners when choosing what badges to include in their curricula. We believe our
findings exist as one piece of the large research base needed to understand educational badges.

### Enhancing software engineering student team engagement in a high-intensity extreme programming course using gamification

*Akpolat, B., & Slany, W.*

**Abstract**

The use of game thinking and game mechanics in non-gaming context is becoming more and more popular. This has been known as gamification. Recent studies have shown that this attempt seems very promising in different areas. In this paper we explore the value of gamification in a software development team. This paper describes one approach to add gamification into the software development process in teams of ten students each. We have conducted a gamification study with 50 volunteer students. In this paper we explain the rules, terms, and findings of this study.

### Engaging with Massive Online Courses

*Ashton Anderson, Daniel Huttenlocher, Jon Kleinberg, Jure Leskovec*

**Abstract**

The Web has enabled one of the most visible recent developments
in education—the deployment of massive open online courses. With
their global reach and often staggering enrollments, MOOCs have
the potential to become a major new mechanism for learning. Despite this early promise, however, MOOCs are still relatively unexplored and poorly understood.
In a MOOC, each student’s complete interaction with the course
materials takes place on the Web, thus providing a record of learner
activity of unprecedented scale and resolution. In this work, we
use such trace data to develop a conceptual framework for understanding how users currently engage with MOOCs. We develop a
taxonomy of individual behavior, examine the different behavioral
patterns of high- and low-achieving students, and investigate how
forum participation relates to other parts of the course.
We also report on a large-scale deployment of badges as incentives for engagement in a MOOC, including randomized experiments in which the presentation of badges was varied across subpopulations. We find that making badges more salient produced
increases in forum engagement.

### Improving participation and learning with gamification

*Barata, Gama, Jorge, & Gonçalves,*

**Abstract**

In this paper we explore how gamification can be applied to education in order to improve student engagement. We present a study in which a college course was gamified, by including experience points, levels, badges, challenges and leaderboards. The study was five years long, where the first three were non-gamified years, and the last two regarded two successive experiments of our gamified approach. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compared data from both gamified and non-gamified years, using different performance measures. Results show significant improvements in terms of attention to reference materials, online participation and proactivity. They also suggest that our approach can reduce grade discrepancies among students and help them score better. Modeling course activities with game challenges and properly distributing those over the term seem to enhance this effect.

### Gamifying the Learning of Design Patterns in Software Engineering Education

*Bartel & Hagel*

**Abstract**

In this contribution a process and a way for a standardized documentation are proposed for the creation of gamified and competency-based learning activities. Furthermore the application of the process and its documentation is described by using an exemplary learning activity which was created, implemented and evaluated. The findings indicate, that the use of gamification design elements for learning a design pattern can be effective and successful and can lead to an increase in learning motivation.

### Gamification of a Software Engineering course and a detailed analysis of the factors that lead to it's failure

*Berkling & Thomas, 2013*

**Abstract**

This paper describes the setup for a gamified classroom for the subject of Software Engineering. A series of papers have resulted from this work: “Understanding Student Motivation” at CSEDU 2013 [1] and “Bridging the Motivation Gap”, an IGIP SPEED Young Scientist award paper here at ICL 2013 [2]. The intention behind gamifying the course was to increase student engagement and motivation by allowing for independent learning with flexible speed and choice of emphasis. Daniel Pink's [3] motivational theory, which is also found in gamification factors, outlines that autonomy, mastery and purpose lead to these goals. The adopted approach also deals nicely with the vast differences regarding background knowledge and the spread of interest of each of the students. During the latter part of the course a student survey was conducted. Out of 90 students, 59 answered. As a general rule, students did not receive the gamification ideas in a positive light. We examine what went wrong regarding the gamification factors and propose changes for the next iteration of the course.

### Gamification as a tool for increasing the depth of student understanding using a collaborative e-learning environment

*Betts, Bal, & Betts, 2013*

**Abstract**

This paper briefly describes a collaborative learning environment created to improve participation in online learning. The environment, called Curatr, utilised the notion of game-like behaviours, colloquially known as 'gamification', to shape learners behaviour towards participating in social and collaborative learning activities, such as commenting, sharing and peer-marking. In the case study described, 33 students made 6,152 contributions during a six-month part-time online continuing education course. Findings suggest that the number of 'experience points' a student earns on the platform is highly correlated with the average assignment mark they achieve (r = 0.499 n = 33). The results suggest that gamification can help improve the learning experience and the resulting performance for groups of students. There are limitations to this finding. Within the group there are cases where contribution and resulting performance do not correlate. Further work assessing the quality of contributions is suggested to understand this effect better.

### Improving Student Attitudes Toward the Capstone Laboratory Course Using Gamification

*Burkey, Anastasio, & Suresh, 2013*

**Abstract**

Introduction of Gamification Elements into a Chemical Engineering Laboratory CourseGamification, or the introduction of game-like mechanics into non-game contexts, has receivedincreasing attention recently, largely for its perceived ability to motivate participants into desiredcourses of action by making mandatory or mundane tasks rewarding in some way. Examples ofthis in the business world include frequent flyer reward programs, social programs such asFourSquare or Facebook Check In, and app-type gamification of to-do lists, weight-lossprograms, or exercise programs.Application of gamification to education is a logical extension, as it has the potential to motivatestudents to perform extra learning tasks that they might not otherwise do by couching those tasksin the larger context of a game, or by providing small but tangible non-grade rewards for theircompletion. To study this phenomenon, we chose to overlay a collaborative team-based gamecontext over the traditional senior capstone chemical engineering laboratory course. As alaboratory course, the structure is such that students are naturally clustered into teams workingon different experiments. This allowed us to easily divide the students into teams (‘guilds’ in ourexample) that were united by a common purpose – completing their major experiment. Bycompleting required tasks such as lab reports and presentations, students earned XP (experiencepoints), which translated directly into a traditional grade. In addition, other, optional tasks wereadded that could earn a student additional XP (effectively extra credit), but also another resource,called Reputation. While reputation did not affect a student’s grade directly, by workingcollectively with other students in their guild, students could pool Reputation to effectively ‘win’the game. In this context, the guild with the most reputation at the end of the semester wasallowed to choose from several rewards (dinner out with the faculty, the ability to choose anexperiment the following semester, a small boost to one of their best grades, etc.). Optional taskswere ones that the instructors thought would benefit the students, but in practice, withoutincentivization, few students attempted. Examples include peer evaluation of their work, seekingout and using external references in their writing, and performing data analysis during the courseof the experiment and using that information to modify their experimental plan.Both pre- and post-course surveys were carried out, which collected data on the students’experience with a multitude of game types, as well as their personal habits. Additionally, theirattitude and perceptions about gamification and our particular implementation were surveyedboth prior to the start of the class and after the semester ended to compare differences. This paperwill discuss the specific implementation of the gamification process as applied to the laboratorycourse, as well as make a determination as to its future course based on the outcome of thestudent surveys and level of participation. (For consideration as a paper).

### The effects of gamification on student attendance and team performance in a third-year undergraduate game production module

*Caton & Greenhill, 2013*

This paper investigates the effects of a gamified awards and penalties framework on a third-year undergraduate game production module which has a predominantly male demographic. Students work in teams of three game programmers and two artists to develop a computer game prototype, applying their game-programming knowledge and game theory to complete the project. 'Gamification' harnesses the reward and penalty game mechanics and apply it to real-world problems, such as, the motivational challenges that can be a stumbling block to many student team projects. Achieving an award is a framework for incorporating competition-based learning into the classroom, while the issuing of penalties is a system for encouraging attendance. Penalty cards issued for absence (and other infractions) affected grades. However, the receiving of an award was not connected to the assessment. The benefits and drawbacks of students collaborating on team projects have been well studied. From the student's point of view, the main drawback of teambased learning is most commonly unequal contribution. Using game theory as a basis for establishing a system of awards and penalties, this paper offers a gamified framework to keep students equally contributing to team efforts. This paper asks three questions: 1) Does the awards/penalties framework improve attendance? 2) If yes, does improved attendance result in improved assessments? 3) Does the framework improve cohesion and performance in student teams? This paper presents quantitative evidence to answer the first two and offers speculative comments on the third. Initial results suggest that the awards and penalties framework improves attendance and increases student performance and overall grade. Speculatively, the framework appears to be effective in increasing motivation. Informal student commentary indicates that while motivation is not improved across the cohort, those that are motivated contribute significantly more time and effort to the project. Awards proved successful in improving completion of previously resisted tasks and, if timed correctly, can attract students to attend a class they would otherwise choose to miss

### Key Attributes of Engagement in a Gamified Learning Environment

*de Byl & Hooper, 2013*

**Abstract**

Successful computer games and effective educational environments share many similar key attributes relating to instruction, goals, feedback and interaction. Unfortunately, many educators find it difficult to implement strategies in their curriculum to compete with the engagement of computer games. The recent surge in the popularity of gamification may hold the key and provide a framework by which teachers can implement simple strategies to increase engagement in their classrooms. To contribute to this domain about the affordances of gamification in education, this paper argues that the key attributes of engagement are the same whether they are in an education or game setting. It also extends a previous study that revealed a five dimensional model of gamified curriculum factors and examines each with respect to student engagement. The conclusion is the amount of engagement in the gamified classroom is dependent on the individual student's playfulness and acceptance of innovative and dynamic pedagogies.

### An empirical study comparing gamification and social networking on e-learning

*de-Marcos, Domínguez, Saenz-de-Navarrete, & Pagés, June 2014*

**Abstract**

While social networking has already demonstrated its efficiency in e-learning, gamification, which is the use of game-thinking and playful design in non-game contexts, has only shown its potential as a motivational tool. This paper presents the results of testing both social networking and gamification in an undergraduate course, comparing them in terms their effect on students' academic achievement, participation and attitude. The effects of a gamification plugin deployed in a learning management system were compared to those of a social networking site in the same educational setting. We found that both approaches presented better performance than a traditional e-learning approach in terms of academic achievement for practical assignments, but that, when it came to assessing knowledge, the traditional e-learning approach was better. Also challenging current assumptions, participation rates and scores remained low with the new tools, although students' attitudes were positive.

### The domestication of digital games in the lives of older adults

*De Schutter & Abeele, 2014*

**Abstract**

The current study aims to integrate the findings of previous research on the use of video games by older adults by applying the domestication framework developed in the 1990s. A qualitative study was performed with 35 participants aged between 49 and 73, who were targeted purposefully from a larger sample of 213. The analysis revealed how older adults appropriated digital games using pre-existing, public and co-constructed meanings, as well as how such meanings influence the incorporation of digital games in their daily routine. The study also reveals how the transformation of personal meanings into the public realm can be obstructed by social factors. Finally, the usefulness of the domestication framework for this topic of study as well as implications for future research are discussed.

### The effect of virtual achievements on student engagement

*Denny, 2013*

**Abstract**

Badge-based achievement systems are being used increasingly to drive user participation and engagement across a variety of platforms and contexts. Despite positive anecdotal reports, there is currently little empirical evidence to support their efficacy in particular domains. With the recent rapid growth of tools for online learning, an interesting open question for educators is the extent to which badges can positively impact student participation. In this paper, we report on a large-scale (n > 1000) randomized, controlled experiment measuring the impact of incorporating a badge-based achievement system within an online learning tool. We discover a highly significant positive effect on the quantity of students' contributions, without a corresponding reduction in their quality, as well as on the period of time over which students engaged with the tool. Students enjoyed being able to earn badges, and indicated a strong preference for having them available in the user interface.

### Gamifying Learning Experiences: Practical Implications and Outcomes

*Domínguez, et al., 2013*

**Abstract**

Gamification is the use of game design elements and game mechanics in non-game contexts. This idea has been used successfully in many web based businesses to increase user engagement. Some researchers suggest that it could also be used in web based education as a tool to increase student motivation and engagement. In an attempt to verify those theories, we have designed and built a gamification plugin for a well-known e-learning platform. We have made an experiment using this plugin in a university course, collecting quantitative and qualitative data in the process. Our findings suggest that some common beliefs about the benefits obtained when using games in education can be challenged. Students who completed the gamified experience got better scores in practical assignments and in overall score, but our findings also suggest that these students performed poorly on written assignments and participated less on class activities, although their initial motivation was higher.

### Gamification in a Social Learning Environment

*Giannetto, Chao, & Fontana, 2013*

**Abstract**

Gamification has gained traction in recent years as an effective way of engaging users to perform actions in contexts that would otherwise be considered tedious and undesirable. Education is an area in which user engagement could have the greatest impact on success, with some advantages for students being improved grades or better comprehension. The authors of this paper have designed and implemented a three part system for gamifying a social learning environment designed for use in higher educ ation lecture classrooms. Our goal in doing so is to foster greater user engagement from the students using the system and thereby promote an environment better suited for active learning.

### COR: A new course framework based on elements of game design

*Gibbons, T. (2013).*

**Abstract**

Taking cues from the root causes of anxiety and poor student performance, a new course framework is developed using three key elements of game play. These game play elements are abstracted into an integrated teaching framework that gives students a choice in actions, options for cooperation and competition, and allows for revisions of work. Two case studies are examined that demonstrate how this framework can be implemented. One shows how this framework can be incorporated in the final project of a systems analysis and design course. The other shows how the framework can be used in a game design course to prepare students for different career paths.

### Gamification and Web-based Homework

*Goehle, 2013*

**Abstract**

In this paper we demonstrate how video game mechanics can be used to help improve student engagement with online mathematics homework. Specifically, we integrate two common video game systems, levels and achievements, with the online homework program *WeBWorK*. We describe the key features of the implementation of these systems and discuss how students responded after they were used in a calculus class.

### Maximising Gain for Minimal Pain: Utilising Natural Game Mechanics

*Gordon, Brayshaw, & Grey, 2013*

**Abstract**

This paper considers the application of natural games mechanics within higher education as a vehicle to encourage student engagement and achievement of desired learning outcomes. It concludes with desiderata of features for a learning environment when used for assessment and a reflection on the gap between current and aspired learning provision. The context considered is higher (tertiary) education, where the aims are both to improve students’ engagement with course content and also to bring about potential changes in the students’ learning behaviour. Whilst traditional approaches to teaching and learning may focus on dealing with large classes, where the onus is frequently on efficiency and on the effectiveness of feedback in improving understanding and future performance, intelligent systems can provide technology to enable alternative methods that can cope with large classes that preserve the cost benefits. However, such intelligent systems may also offer improved learning outcomes via a personalised learning experience. This paper looks to exploit particular properties which emerge from the game playing process and seek to engage them in a wider educational context. In particular we aim to use game engagement and flow as natural dynamics that can be exploited in the learning experience. Read More: http://journals.heacademy.ac.uk/doi/abs/

### How (not) to introduce badges to online exercises

*Haaranen, Ihantola, Hakulinen, & Korhonen, 2014*

**Abstract**

Achievement badges are increasingly used to enhance educational systems and they have been shown to affect student behavior in different ways. However, details on best practices and effective concepts to implement badges from a non-technical point of view are scarce. We implemented badges to our learning management system, used them on a large course and collected feedback from students. Based on our experiences, we present recommendations to other educators that plan on using badges.

### The Effect of Gamification on Students with Different Achievement Goal Orientations

*Hakulinen & Auvinen, 2014*

**Abstract**

In this study, we examined gamification in relation to achievement goal orientation. Achievement goal orientation is a psychological conceptualization that characterizes students' preferences to different goals, outcomes and rewards. We added achievement badges to an online learning environment used in a Data Structures and Algorithms course (N=278), and examined the responses of students with different achievement goal orientation profiles. Furthermore, we analyzed how students who were most motivated by badges differ from others in terms of achievement goal orientation and behavior. We found no significant differences in the behavior of the different goal orientation groups regarding badges when analyzing the log data from the learning environment. However, their attitudes towards the badges varied. On the other hand, we found that students who reported high motivation towards badges had higher mastery-intrinsic, mastery-extrinsic and performance-approach orientation, and lower avoidance-orientation than others. All of them were already high-performing before the badges were introduced. However, not all high-performing students were motivated by the badges. We also identified a small avoidance-oriented group who reported very low motivation towards the badges. The results of this paper shed light on the reasons why students respond differently to gamification and on what underlying motivational aspects might contribute to a high or low motivation towards gamification.

### Teaching creative problem solving in a MOOC

*Hentenryck & Coffrin, 2014*

**Abstract**

The practice of discrete optimization involves modeling and solving complex combinatorial problems which have never been encountered before and for which no universal computational paradigm exists. Teaching such skills is challenging: Students must learn, not only the core technical skills, but also an ability to think creatively in order to select and adapt a paradigm to solve the problem at hand. This paper explores the question of whether the teaching of such creative skills translates to massive open online courses (MOOCs). It first describes a methodology for teaching discrete optimization that has been successful on campus over fifteen years. It then discusses how to adapt the campus format to a MOOC version. The success of the approach is evaluated through extensive data analytics enabled by the wealth of information produced by MOOCs.

### GradeCraft: What can we learn from a game-inspired learning management system?

*Holman, Aguilar, & Fishman, 2013*

**Abstract**

The "gamification" of courses (i.e., designing courses that leverage motivational mechanisms found in videogames) is a movement that is gaining traction in educational research communities and universities. Two game-inspired courses were developed at a high-enrollment public university in an effort to increase student engagement, and to provide students with more personalized learning experiences. We designed a learning management system, GradeCraft, to foreground the affordances of these grading systems, and to enhance the "game-like" experience for students. Along with serving as a translation layer for the grading systems of these courses, GradeCraft is also designed with an eye towards learning analytics, and captures information that can be described as student "process" data. Currently this data includes what types of assignments students choose to complete; how students assign percentage weights to their chosen assignments; how often and how accurately students check or model their course grades; and how successfully assignments are completed by students individually and the class as a whole across a structured grading rubric. We hope GradeCraft will give instructors new insight into student engagement, and provide data-driven ideas about how to tailor courses to student needs.

### An experience report on using gamification in technical higher education

*Iosup & Epema, 2014*

Technical universities, especially in Europe, are facing an important challenge in attracting more diverse groups of students, and in keeping the students they attract motivated and engaged in the curriculum. We describe our experience with gamification, which we loosely define as a teaching technique that uses social gaming elements to deliver higher education. Over the past three years, we have applied gamification to undergraduate and graduate courses in a leading technical university in the Netherlands and in Europe. Ours is one of the first long-running attempts to show that gamification can be used to teach technically challenging courses. The two gamification-based courses, the first-year B.Sc. course Computer Organization and an M.Sc.-level course on the emerging technology of Cloud Computing, have been cumulatively followed by over 450 students and passed by over 75% of them, at the first attempt. We find that gamification is correlated with an increase in the percentage of passing students, and in the participation in voluntary activities and challenging assignments. Gamification seems to also foster interaction in the classroom and trigger students to pay more attention to the design of the course. We also observe very positive student assessments and volunteered testimonials, and a Teacher of the Year award.

### Casual Social Games as Serious Games: The Psychology of Gamification in Undergraduate Education and Employee Training

*Landers & Callan, 2011*

**Abstract**

Gameification (or, gamification) is becoming an increasingly popular technique to motivate learners, yet little theory or empirical evidence is available to support its use. In the present chapter, instructional design in relation to games and gameification is explored, including discussion of the psychological determinants of learning. The extant research literatures surrounding online social media, learning-by-testing, and goal-setting theory are then integrated in order to provide a scientific rationale for gameification. The resulting integrative theory of gameification in learning suggests that students may learn more by completing tests than they do when studying, that students can be motivated to complete such tests by offering them social rewards in the form of carefully designed virtual badges, and that these badges should be offered in an online social context which students find meaningful in order to motivate them to action. To examine this integrative theory, an online social network with gameification elements was created and deployed in a Psychology department at a major east coast university in order to motivate students to complete optional online multiple choice quizzes. The system was highly successful; 29% of participants opted to complete gameified optional multiple choice quizzes and on average reported those quizzes as fun, enjoyable, and rewarding. This proof-of-concept study is discussed in terms of its implications for both undergraduate education and employee training, including a list of current “best practices” regarding social game implementation.

### APPLICATION OF GAME MECHANICS TO IMPROVE STUDENT ENGAGEMENT

*Leong & Yanjie, 2011*

**Abstract**

The new generation of students poses a challenge to educators. Given their obsessive use of
online social networks and video games, they have shorter attention spans and are more easily distracted, making it harder to engage them in class. In this paper, we describe how we
experimented with game mechanics to engage students enrolled in CS1101S, an introductory
programming methodology course taken by first year undergraduates in the School of
Computing. To investigate how well the use of game mechanics can encourage students to
work consistently and improve their learning process, we built JFDI Academy, an online
learning platform that supplements CS1101S. The platform is used by students to submit their assignments and to discuss their solutions with tutors. As students complete assignments, they are awarded experience points, and "level-up". Students are also motivated to work hard via other game mechanics such as a leaderboard and a storyline that advances as they complete missions. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach by administering surveys to them, once during the middle of the course and once at the end. We found that the average assignment submission times improved from less than a day (15.5) hours before the deadline to more than two days (51.2 hours) before the deadline. The students also claimed that the game system made the course interesting and motivated them to work beyond what is minimally required. This shows that the use of game mechanics can indeed help to engage the new generation of students. However, our survey results also show that game mechanics work best only when the fundamentals of the course, such the lectures and the quality of the teaching staff, are already sound.

### CADament: A gamified multiplayer software tutorial system

*Li, Grossman, & Fitzmaurice, 2014*

We present CADament, a gamified multiplayer tutorial system for learning AutoCAD. Compared with existing gamified software tutorial systems, CADament generates engaging learning experience through competitions. We investigate two variations of our game, where over-the-shoulder learning was simulated by providing viewports into other player's screens. We introduce an empirical lab study methodology where participants compete with one another, and we study knowledge transfer effects by tracking the migration of strategies between players during the study session. Our study shows that CADament has an advantage over pre-authored tutorials for improving learners' performance, increasing motivation, and stimulating knowledge transfer.

### Motivation and manipulation: A gamification approach to influencing undergraduate attitudes in computing

*Mitchell, Danino, & May, 2013*

This paper describes how the introduction of competitive elements to an introductory undergraduate module in Computing at the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) enabled the teaching team to motivate, engage, and influence the behaviour and expectations of new students. The Four Week Challenge (4WC) forms the first module that all students encounter on a number of different Computing courses. It is run in full-time "burst mode" during the students' first month at UCLan, with the start of regular teaching delayed until after this module has finished. It is designed to lead students through a challenging (yet highly scaffolded) project to show them where their course could take them. The students work in teams of six on a series of incremental challenges. The ultimate goal for teams on the module is to build a sophisticated mobile phone game, market it on-line, and present it in an academic context. Moreover, the module itself is run as a game, with teams competing against each other not only to build the best game, but also to be the most effective team. Important in getting the students to embrace the idea of the module as a game was instilling a belief that the teams were fairly matched, and that each had an equal chance of success. To this end we devised a method of sorting students into balanced teams based on: a) their chosen course within Computing; b) their preferred team role; and c) their existing competence at computer programming. The challenges in each week follow themes within computing, giving the opportunity for different individuals in each team to come to the fore throughout the module according to their interest. Points were awarded to each team on a daily basis for various activities, and a running total displayed as a Leader Board in the foyer of the Computing building. This public and regularly updated display fuelled a strong sense of competition between the teams, motivating them to work harder and achieve better results. Since the 4WC is an assessed module (10 ECTS credits) both output and teamwork are graded each week. As well as contributing to the teams' final grade for the module, these marks are also translated into points for the Leader Board. Besides academic learning outcomes, the 4WC has been designed to address issues of retention and engagement in Computing at UCLan. One aim is to foster a culture of peer-support, where no student would feel isolated on the course. Specific activities where points are awarded only if all members of the team make a defined contribution encourage the stronger team-members to support the less experienced. Again with the promise of points, students are encouraged to share knowledge and techniques. In presentations, students are supportive of other teams, asking questions and offering advice. By the end of the month are publishing their own tutorials and running their own help classes. An awards ceremony is held at the end of the module, with prizes for the overall winning team, and also in several other categories.

### Khan Academy gamifies computer science

*Morrison & DiSalvo, 2014*

**Abstract**

Gamification is the buzzword for adding gaming elements such as points or badges to learning experiences to make them more engaging and to increase motivation. In this paper we explore how Khan Academy has incorporated gaming elements into its CS learning platform. By mapping the literature on motivational processes to popular games we critically analyze how successful Khan Academy is at gamifying their site.

### A case study in the gamification of a university-level games development course

*O’Donovan, Gain, & Marais, 2013*

**Abstract**

Gamification is the application of game mechanics and player incentives to non-game environments. When designed correctly, gamification has been found to increase engagement and encourage targeted behaviours among users. This paper presents the gamification of a university course in Computer Games Development using an online learning management tool, including how this might generalize to other courses. Our goal with gamification was to improve lecture attendance, content understanding, problem solving skills and general engagement. The success of this intervention was measured using course marks, lecturer evaluations, lecture attendance, and a questionnaire; all with strongly positive results. However, this must be balanced against the costs, both monetary and time, required to successfully implement gamification.

### Motivational active learning: engaging university students in computer science education

*Pirker, Riffnaller-Schiefer, & Gütl, 2014*

**Abstract**

Attracting and engaging computer science students to enhance their mathematical and algorithmic thinking skills are challenging tasks. In winter 2013 we introduced a new teaching format for a course, which combines theory in computer science with hands-on algorithmic challenges, mathematical thinking activities, and collaborative problem-solving. Therefore, we introduced the pedagogical model Motivational Active Learning (MAL), which is grounded in MIT's successful format for teaching physics, Technology-Enabled Active Learning (TEAL), and combines it with motivational strategies usually used by game designers. Results from the initial setup in class reveals that students indeed assessed the course structure as more interactive and motivating compared to other similar courses. In this paper we discuss the course design, issues, and the impact, and analyze the first results in detail.

### Redesign of a gamified Software Engineering course

*Thomas & Berkling, 2013*

**Abstract**

This paper builds on work previously published as best paper at CSEDU 2013 [1], which describes the motivation gap between the teacher's view of student motivation and their actual motivation. As a result of this mismatch, the gamified Software Engineering course under observation [2], did not appeal to the students in the expected way. Our findings give rise to a number of design criteria for e-Learning and blended course that address the motivation gap in order to increase the number students that are able to self-regulate their studies and stay or become motivated by the course as defined by Dan Pink's motivational factors: autonomy, mastery and purpose [3].

### The gamification of the study of electronics in dedicated e-learning platforms

*Todor & Pitica, 2013*

**Abstract**

This paper presents several examples of implementing the concept of gamification in an e-learning platform specialized in the study of electronics. This concept requires the use of the game mechanics and thinking for non-game applications to actively involve users in solving a problem [1]. It can be implemented in an e-learning platform aimed to motivate the students in continuous learning, to improve the quality of provided information and to promote certain behaviors to be learned by them.

### Gamification in the Classroom: Old Wine in New Badges

*Werbach & Johnson, 2012*

**Abstract**

The term “gamification” is relatively new, but its exact origins are not known. The first recorded use was in the digital media industry in 2008 and it has become popular in the last couple of years (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011). A search performed in October 2012 on Google Scholar using the term “gamification” turned up over 1,000 publications, and the same search in May 2014 produced over 1 2 3 62 7,000 publications. 80,000 people were registered in the Coursera Gamification course in Sept/Oct 2012 (Werbach, 2012). The attention that gamification gets from industry, as well as from the public, makes it one of the newer concepts of the use of games in the real world to surface in recent years. This chapter analyzes the potential and limits of gamification for learning and classroom use. Gamification can be broadly defined as the application of game features and game mechanics in a non-game context, but does not typically include using actual games. In the most commonly promoted approach to gamification (Zichermann & Cunningham, 2011), designers seeking to create a gamification system first identify behaviors that are to be encouraged, and then assign rewards to that behavior. These reward systems can take different forms—points, achievements, and badges are three typical tools for motivation and manipulation. The concept of using rewards to modify behavior is nothing new to teachers in a classroom setting. Teachers often use point systems for both learning and behavioral goals. If one takes into account the concept that the absence of a punishment is the same as a reward (Kohn, 1999), then teachers have used reward-based systems as the core of classroom management for centuries. The syllabus in the classroom is a gamification layer that is used to motivate students’ involvement in course content. If we consider the concept of levels in games, then certainly the grades (K-12) and years (freshman, junior, senior, sophomore) of formal education are the very embodiment of “levels.” There are known requirements for completing one level and just like in games, each new level opens up new content and additional options. The idea of earning badges within a game as a means of marking achievement is also not unique to games. Children in elementary school often get stickers for completed work; both the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides (as well as a great many other organizations) use badges to symbolize various achievements, and of course, medals and badges have been a longstanding tradition in militaries throughout the world. The notion of leaderboards is also not unique to videogames, or games of any sort for that matter, as they can be found in many businesses as ways to highlight sales records for example, and in schools to commemorate a myriad of achievements academic and otherwise. Even the concept of a letter grade is remarkably similar to a badge, as it indicates achievement in a standardized way that has meaning outside of the learning environment. Some applications of gamification go beyond merely using rewards such as points, badges and levels to motivate. Meaningful Gamification is the concept of using elements from games to help participants find a personal and meaningful connection within a specific context. Many of the theories behind meaningful gamification are educational theories such as Universal Design for Learning and motivational theories, such as Self-Determination Theory. These theories provide ways to use concepts of play, reflection, and narrative (instead of rewards) to engage learners (Nicholson, 2012a). Teachers have used game-based elements for the real world application of teaching content for decades. While the term of gamification is new, the underlying concepts for both reward-based and meaningful gamification have been explored in the classroom for some time. In this chapter, we will review different 63 models for gamification in the classroom, explore some of the benefits and hazards to using it, and present some case studies and best practices for instructors to use. The goal of this chapter is to explore gamification in the classroom from different perspectives and present guidance to instructors looking to use elements of games and play to improve learning motivation.
